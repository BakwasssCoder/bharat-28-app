3. Navigate to the SQL Editor
4. Run this SQL command to add the password_hash column:
   
   ALTER TABLE admins ADD COLUMN password_hash TEXT;

5. After running that command, run this SQL command to create the admin user with password:
   
   INSERT INTO admins (username, role, password_hash) 
   VALUES ('admin', 'admin', '$2b$10$rVv.F4XaNJ0uSwV.kk.2QO3SZjOFEfB/PdIXrJDxV8M9XqnddHkdO');
